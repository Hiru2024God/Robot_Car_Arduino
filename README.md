🚗 Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car using Arduino

This project is a simple Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car built using an Arduino Uno (or compatible board), ultrasonic sensor, and a basic motor driver module. The robot intelligently detects obstacles in its path and automatically avoids them by changing direction.

🔧 Features :-

    - Real-time obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor.
    - Compact and beginner-friendly design.
    - Control Using Bluetooth.

🧰 Components Used :-

    1. Arduino Uno or Nano
    2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
    3. Motor Driver Module (L298N)
    4. Two DC Motors with Wheels
    5. Chassis and battery pack
    6. Jumper wires

⚙️ How It Works :-

The HC-SR04 sensor measures the distance to objects in front of the robot. If an object is too close, the Arduino makes the car stop and turn in another direction. This allows the robot to navigate around obstacles without human input. And also, you can use any robot Car control application to control your robot car using your mobile or laptop Bluetooth.
